# Bangladesh-Economic-Indicators-Data-Analysis
A data analytics project where I try to find insights and trends from Bangladesh Economic indicator data collected and extracted from World Bank website. The Entire work from data analysis to written insights everything is inside the excel workbook in sheet by sheet. The original dataset is the third sheet from the end. Have a look at the insights and trends by clicking through the sheets.
